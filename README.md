# Title: Predicting the future value of Bitcoins using the BitVaRYÂ® method (an implementation of the GBM Method)

## Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose: 
We are developing a model which attempts to predict future bitcoin values based on historical opening and closing values of bitcoins. The underlying calculation for this model is based on the GBM (Geometrical Brownian Motion) model which is used to predict values of stocks trading in the stock-market. We are using similar fundamental rules to come up with a model which predicts Bitcoin values. We will run a Monte-Carlo simulation by iterating through multiple historical data values and validate them against recent historical values. Then, we will compare how accurate our predictions were. Our goal is to reach a prediction level with 80% accuracy. Our model will compare predictions to actual values for a 30 day period.


## Hypothesis before running the simulation:
1. BITCOIN prices are greatly associated with historical BITCOIN prices
2. BITCOIN prices will increase for a very long time before saturating/declining
3. The BitVaRY model The BitVaRY model provides at least an 80% accurate prediction of future bitcoin values based on historical bitcoin opening and closing values

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty: List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and which probability distribution to use?
Explanatory variables: Opening Price, Closing Price, Date
Response variable: Predicted bitcoin value
For the opening and closing prices, the range is defined by the historical lowest and highest values that the bitcoin held. These values are updated in real-time and the range for both these variables keeps changing as each day passes.
The probability distribution is a normal distribution which is represented by a log function of the price fluctuation over time.
This model would be a good representation of reality and a great tool for bitcoin miners and investors!

## Instructions on how to use the program:
1. Download and run the script BitVary_v2.py"!
2. There are 2 options: The current version of our code uses the function "simulation_v2", but you can change this to "simulation_v1" to run the simulation using version 1

## Simulation Results and Observations:
We have developed 2 versions simulation functions to simulate the data. You can change the simulation function version and see how the results are similar despite using different simulation techniques. This helps us note that the findings drawn from our simulations have a high chance of being accurate.

Due to the current surge in the Bitcoin price, we did expect the simulations to depict astronoomical increases. What we did not expect were such extreme values (such as $100,000 or even higher), but then again looking at the trend that the Bitcoin has followed over the last month, it sort of justifies a higher than exponential surge in the price.

If we do not include the last few months (November, December), the simulation does mellow down but the observations still show an exponential price increase.
